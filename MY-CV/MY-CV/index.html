    <p>I am a passionate front-end developer with a love for building beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My journey in web development started out of a desire to combine creativity with technology, and over time, it has grown into a full-blown passion.

        With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy bringing designs to life and ensuring that every interaction feels seamless and engaging. I'm currently studying with ALX and expanding my skills in modern web technologies to keep up with the ever-evolving web ecosystem. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the universe from my backyard, diving into astronomy documentaries, or working on personal projects to sharpen my craft.
